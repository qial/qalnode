Qalendar Node.js Backend
------------------------

The Qalendar project is designed to be a flexible database service for life 
organization. It currently works as a JSON service with Google Accounts as
an authorization service. 

An ExtJS UI is being developed at http://github.com/qial/plan-your-base

The hope is for it to be useful as a backend for any app.

Uses:
 - Event Calendar
 - Budgeting
 - ToDo lists
 - Reminders
 
It is written in javascript for Nodejs. It uses the ExpressJS module for app
routing and Mongoose to manipulate a MongoDB backend.
